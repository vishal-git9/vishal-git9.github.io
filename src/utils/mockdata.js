<p>I'm basically a professional puzzle-solver who argues with computers for a living and somehow convinced people this is a real job. I turn "that's impossible" into "oh wait, it actually works" while surviving on coffee and Stack Overflow answers.</p>
<p>I speak fluent front-end, back-end, and "why-is-this-not-working" – think of me as bilingual but nerdier. My code is cleaner than my apartment, and I collect programming languages like some people collect coffee mugs.</p>
<p>Currently turning complex problems into elegant solutions, one caffeine-fueled breakthrough at a time.</p>
Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
